Title: AST Transformations for Humanity

Abstract:
Everyone strives towards readable code, right?
A cool thing about code is that the more it resembles your native language, the cleaner, more readable and human friendly it is.
But in the real world we don't always get to choose the ideal language for our projects; so given this constraint, how can we improve developer experience and ease code maintainability?
In this talk I will show how we can use Python AST transformations to make our code human friendly.

Audience:
This talk is aimed at all developers with intermediate/advanced development and Python experience.
Participants will learn what are AST transformations, how AST transformations work in Python and how they can help developers and non-developers.

Outline:
2m Introduction: Who I am and why you should listen to me
3m Language: Why we should prefer prefer languages that are nearer to our native languages
5m AST: What are AST transformations
15m Live coding: Prettify Python code using AST
5m Q&A

Shortening this session to 30 minutes is fine, but will leave less room for discussion and demos 

Notes:
I'm a fairly experienced speaker. For the past 5 years I've given at least 2 talks every year at international conferences and meetups.
