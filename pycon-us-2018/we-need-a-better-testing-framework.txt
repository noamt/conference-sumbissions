Title: We Need a Better Testing Framework

Abstract:
Python has a super rich and active ecosystem, and py.test is great, but I believe we deserve a better testing framework.
This is why I've started developing a new framework named "Nimoy".
Using Nimoy, I set out to make Python testing beautiful, expressive, pragmatic and fun.

Audience:
This talk is suitable for test writing Python developers of any level.
Participants will learn about different testing paradigms, the importance of clarity, simplicity and maintainability in testing, and how Nimoy can help them. 

Outline:
2m Introduction: Who I am and why you should listen to me
18m What testing tools are available. How can Nimoy improve on them?
5m Live demo: Live coding Nimoy specifications
5m Q&A: Leaving extra time for this as this topic may raise discussions

Notes:

A blog post I've written about why I think a Nimoy is needed: https://medium.com/python-pandemonium/python-needs-a-fresh-testing-framework-19b41f3aa2d

I'm a fairly experienced speaker. For the past 5 years I've given at least 2 talks every year at international conferences and meetups.
