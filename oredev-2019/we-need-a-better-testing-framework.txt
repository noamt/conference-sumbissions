Title: We Need a Better Testing Framework

Abstract:
Python has a super rich and active ecosystem, and py.test is great, but I believe we deserve a better testing framework.
This is why I've started developing a new framework named "Nimoy".
Using Nimoy, I set out to make Python testing beautiful, expressive, pragmatic and fun.

Take aways:
Participants will learn how my framework can help them write better Python tests

Participants will also learn about different testing paradigms, the importance of clarity, simplicity and maintainability in testing
