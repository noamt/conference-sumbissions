 Python has a super rich and active ecosystem, and py.test is great, but I believe we deserve a better testing framework.
This is why I've developed a new testing framework named "Nimoy".
Heavily inspired by the Spock testing framework, the framework introduces a DSL that improves Python testing, but challenges Pythonic idioms.
Using Nimoy, I set out to make Python testing beautiful, expressive, pragmatic and fun.
